### Hello Visitor :wave:

I am an MS Computer Science student at Iowa State University, interested to work in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Recently, I worked at Ancestry Inc as a Data Science Engineering Intern, where I worked on productionalizing ML models, and optimizing the feature engineering process.

I am proficient in Java, Python and C. In Python, I have used Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas and Numpy libraries to build Machine Learning models, perform statistical analysis on genetic data and deploy models to production. In Java, I have worked on J2EE web development, Swing and AWT desktop application development.

Prior to joining ISU, I worked at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a Software Engineer for 2.5 years and later at Infosys Ltd as a Data Engineer for another 2.5 years. Working at these companies was a great experience for me to learn about real world data warehouse systems, data processing, web development and agile methodology.

I consider myself to be a motivated, positive and hard working individual who wants to work on world changing innovative projects.

I am always open to work for technology-driven companies and interesting open-source projects. You can contact me on Github or on any of the below sites:
